# Contributing to minectl ðŸ—º

Welcome, and thank you for considering contributing to minectl ðŸ—º. We encourage you to help out by raising issues,
improving documentation, fixing bugs, or adding new features

If you're interested in contributing please start by reading this document.

## Establishing a Development Environment

Establishing a development environment typically requires:

1. Forking and cloning the repository.
1. Installing development dependencies.

## Contributing Code

To contribute bug fixes or features to minectl ðŸ—º:

1. Communicate your intent.
1. Make your changes.
1. Test your changes.
1. Update documentation and examples.
1. Open a Pull Request (PR).

Communicating your intent lets the minectl ðŸ—º maintainers know that you intend to contribute, and how. This sets you up
for success - you can avoid duplicating an effort that may already be underway, adding a feature that may be rejected,
or heading down a path that you would be steered away from at review time. The best way to communicate your intent is
via a detailed GitHub issue. Take a look first to see if there's already an issue relating to the thing you'd like to
contribute. If there isn't, please raise a new one! Let us know what you'd like to work on, and why.

Be sure to practice [good git commit hygiene] as you make your changes. All but the smallest changes should be broken up
into a few commits that tell a story. Use your git commits to provide context for the folks who will review PR, and the
folks who will be spelunking the codebase in the months and years to come. Ensure each of your commits is signed-off in
compliance with the [Developer Certificate of Origin] by using `git commit -s`.

All minectl ðŸ—º documentation and examples are under revision control; see the
[docs] and [config] directories of this repository. Any change that introduces new behaviour or changes
existing behaviour must include updates to any relevant documentation and examples. Please keep documentation and
example changes in distinct commits.

In summary, please:

* Discuss your change in a GitHub issue before you start.
* Use your Git commit messages to communicate your intent to your reviewers.
* Sign-off on all Git commits by running `git commit -s`
* Add or update tests for all changes.
* Update all relevant documentation and examples.
* If necessary, tidy up your git commit history once your PR is approved.

Thank you for reading through our contributing guide!
